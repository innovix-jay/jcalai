# 🧪 Testing Guide - AI Assistant Fix

## ✅ Changes Made

Based on your October 2025 model information, I've updated JCAL.ai to use the correct model names:

### **Correct Models Now Configured**:
- ✅ **Claude 4.5 Sonnet** (`claude-4.5-sonnet`)
- ✅ **GPT-5** (`gpt-5`)  
- ✅ **Gemini 1.5 Flash** (`gemini-1.5-flash`) - Default, fast, FREE tier
- ✅ **Gemini 2.5 Pro** (`gemini-2.5-pro`) - Reasoning & code

### **What Was Fixed**:
1. ✅ Created `.env.local` with all your API keys
2. ✅ Updated to correct October 2025 model names
3. ✅ Added comprehensive error logging
4. ✅ Created test page to verify each model
5. ✅ Added Gemini 2.5 Pro for complex tasks

## 🚀 **How to Test (Step-by-Step)**

### **Step 1: Restart Your Dev Server**

In your terminal where the server is running:

1. Press `Ctrl + C` to stop the current server
2. Run:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\jason\jcalai
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Wait for: `✓ Ready in X.Xs`

### **Step 2: Open the Test Page**

Go to: **http://localhost:3000/test-ai**

This page will help us diagnose which models work.

### **Step 3: Open Browser Console**

Press `F12` or right-click → "Inspect" → "Console" tab

You'll see detailed logs like:
```
[Model Router] Selected provider: gemini
[Model Router] API key present for gemini - length: 39
[Gemini] Calling API with model: gemini-1.5-flash
[Gemini] API response received
[Model Router] Generation successful!
```

### **Step 4: Test Each Model**

On the `/test-ai` page:

1. **Start with Gemini 1.5 Flash** (FREE tier, best to test first):
   - Select "⚡ Gemini 1.5 Flash"
   - Click "Test API Connection"
   - Watch the console for logs
   - Should see success message!

2. **Then try Gemini 2.5 Pro**:
   - Select "💎 Gemini 2.5 Pro"
   - Click "Test API Connection"
   - Check console

3. **Then try Claude 4.5**:
   - Select "🧠 Claude 4.5 Sonnet"
   - Click "Test API Connection"
   - Check console

4. **Finally try GPT-5**:
   - Select "💬 GPT-5"
   - Click "Test API Connection"
   - Check console

## 🔍 **What to Look For**

### ✅ **SUCCESS Looks Like**:

**In the browser console**:
```
[Model Router] Selected provider: gemini
[Model Router] Reasoning: Cost-effective for simpler tasks. Excellent value for tokens
[Model Router] API key present for gemini - length: 39
[Gemini] Calling API with model: gemini-1.5-flash
[Gemini] API response received
[Model Router] Generation successful! Tokens used: 23
```

**On the page**:
```
✅ SUCCESS!

Model: gemini-1.5-flash
Provider: gemini
Tokens: 23
Cost: $0.000017

Response:
Hello! I'm Gemini, a large language model from Google AI...
```

### ❌ **ERROR Looks Like**:

**In console**:
```
[Gemini] API error response: {
  "error": {
    "code": 404,
    "message": "models/gemini-2.0-flash-exp is not found"
  }
}
```

**On page**:
```
❌ ERROR: Gemini API error (404): Not Found - ...
```

---

## 🐛 **Common Issues & Fixes**

### **Issue 1: "Model not found" (404 error)**

**Problem**: Model name is wrong or model isn't available yet

**Solution**: 
- Gemini 1.5 Flash should definitely work
- If Gemini 2.5 Pro gives 404, it means Google hasn't released it to API yet
- Fall back to Gemini 1.5 Flash (works great!)

### **Issue 2: "API key not configured"**

**Problem**: `.env.local` not loaded

**Solution**:
```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
# Verify file exists:
cat .env.local

# Should show your API keys
# Restart server:
npm run dev
```

### **Issue 3: "Invalid API key" (401/403 error)**

**Problem**: API key is expired or wrong

**Solution**:
- Check `JCALAI_PRIVATE_CONFIG.txt` for correct keys
- Regenerate API key if needed
- Update `.env.local`
- Restart server

### **Issue 4: "Rate limit exceeded"**

**Problem**: Too many requests (unlikely on first test)

**Solution**:
- Wait 1-2 minutes
- Try different model
- Gemini has generous free tier

## 🎯 **After Test Page Works**

Once at least ONE model works on `/test-ai`, go back to your project:

1. **Create a new project** or open existing one
2. **Open AI Assistant** (should auto-open for new projects)
3. **Watch console** while chatting
4. **Chat normally** - should now get real responses!

---

## 📊 **Expected Behavior Now**

### **Instead of this** ❌:
```
User: "goal is to connect people"
AI: "I'm having trouble processing that. Could you tell me more..."
```

### **You should see this** ✅:
```
User: "goal is to connect people"
AI: "Excellent! A social platform to connect people at scale. 
Let me gather a few more details to create the perfect plan:

1. What core features do you envision? (posts, messaging, 
   friend connections, groups, events, etc.)

2. Any specific audience or community focus? (students, 
   professionals, hobbyists, local communities, etc.)

3. Design preferences - modern/minimalist or feature-rich 
   with lots of functionality?

I'll create a comprehensive project plan once I understand 
your complete vision! 🚀"
```

The AI will **actually understand context** and ask **relevant follow-up questions**!

## 🚨 **If Still Not Working**

If you've done all this and still getting errors:

1. **Copy the console error** (the red text)
2. **Take screenshot** of the error
3. **Share with me** - I'll debug the exact issue

The console logs will tell us **exactly** what's failing:
- Wrong model name? We'll see the 404
- Bad API key? We'll see the 401
- Network issue? We'll see connection error
- Code bug? We'll see the stack trace

---

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

1. **Start with Gemini 1.5 Flash** - it's free and very reliable
2. **Keep console open** - you'll see exactly what's happening
3. **Try one model at a time** - easier to debug
4. **Check for red errors** in console - those are the clues
5. **Model not working?** Try another - you have 4 options!

## 📧 **Need Help?**

If stuck, send me:
1. Screenshot of `/test-ai` page results
2. Screenshot of console errors (if any)
3. Which model you're testing

I'll help identify the exact issue!
