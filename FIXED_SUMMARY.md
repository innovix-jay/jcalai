# ✅ JCAL.ai - Environment Variable Issue FIXED!

## 🎉 Status: **FULLY OPERATIONAL**

Your JCAL.ai development server is now running successfully!

---

## 🐛 What Was Wrong?

The `.env.local` file had **incorrect encoding** which prevented Next.js from reading the environment variables. This caused:
- ❌ Supabase client errors
- ❌ Middleware blocking all requests
- ❌ Server timeouts
- ❌ Pages not loading

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed?

1. **Recreated `.env.local` with proper ASCII encoding**
   - All 5 API keys now load correctly
   - Supabase URL and keys are accessible
   
2. **Updated middleware.ts**
   - Added graceful fallback for missing env vars
   - Added console warnings for debugging
   
3. **Updated next.config.js**
   - Explicitly declared environment variables
   
4. **Added diagnostic tools**
   - `/status` page - Quick server status check
   - `/env-test` page - Environment variable verification
   - `/test-ai` page - AI model testing
