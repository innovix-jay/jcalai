# Error Mitigation Audit & Fixes

## üîç Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ CRITICAL: Infinite Recursion in RLS Policies

**Issue**: Circular dependencies in Row Level Security policies
- `projects` policies checked `project_collaborators`
- `project_collaborators` policies checked `projects`
- `pages` policies checked `projects` which could check `collaborators`
- This created infinite loops causing "infinite recursion detected" errors

**Fix**: Created migration `006_fix_rls_recursion.sql`
- Removed circular policy dependencies
- Simplified collaborator policies to avoid recursion
- Added `status != 'deleted'` checks for additional safety
- Kept owner-only access for core functionality

**Impact**: Users can now create projects without recursion errors ‚úÖ

### 2. ‚úÖ Database Schema Mismatches

**Issue**: Code used columns that don't exist
- `framework` used as direct column (should be in `config` JSONB)
- `template_id` used as direct column (should be in `ai_metadata` JSONB)
- `content` column for pages (should be `structure` JSONB)

**Fix**: Already fixed in previous commits
- Projects use `config` JSONB for framework settings
- Pages use `structure` JSONB for content
- All required fields included

---

### 3. üîß Potential Error: Missing Error Boundaries

**Issue**: No React error boundaries to catch component errors

**Recommendation**: Add error boundaries in key locations
- Wrap builder workspace
- Wrap dashboard
- Wrap auth pages

**Priority**: Medium (won't cause data loss, but poor UX)

---

### 4. üîß Potential Error: Missing Input Validation

**Issue**: User input not validated before database insert

**Current Risks**:
- Empty project names
- Excessively long descriptions
- Invalid characters in slugs
- Duplicate slugs

**Recommendation**: Add validation
- Min/max length checks
- Slug sanitization
- Duplicate slug detection

**Priority**: Medium (database constraints exist, but UX could be better)

---

### 5. üîß Potential Error: No Rollback on Partial Failures

**Issue**: If page creation fails after project creation, project remains orphaned

**Current Flow**:
```typescript
// Create project
const { data: project } = await supabase.from('projects').insert([...])

// Create page (if this fails, project already exists)
const { error: pageError } = await supabase.from('pages').insert([...])
```

**Recommendation**: Use Supabase RPC with transactions or add cleanup

**Priority**: Low (orphaned projects are harmless, just clutter)

---

### 6. üîß Potential Error: Missing Loading States

**Issue**: Network delays could cause confusion

**Current**: Basic loading spinner
**Recommendation**: More detailed loading states
- "Creating project..."
- "Setting up database..."
- "Initializing workspace..."

**Priority**: Low (UX enhancement)

---

### 7. üîß Potential Error: No Offline Detection

**Issue**: Users might try to create projects while offline

**Recommendation**: Detect offline state and show clear message

**Priority**: Low (nice to have)

---

### 8. ‚úÖ Missing Required Fields

**Issue**: Some database fields marked NOT NULL but not provided

**Check Results**:
- ‚úÖ `projects.user_id` - Provided
- ‚úÖ `projects.name` - Provided
- ‚úÖ `pages.project_id` - Provided
- ‚úÖ `pages.name` - Provided
- ‚úÖ `pages.slug` - Provided
- ‚úÖ `pages.path` - Provided

**Status**: All required fields are provided ‚úÖ

---

### 9. üîß Potential Error: Profiles Table Dependency

**Issue**: Projects reference `profiles.id` but profiles might not exist for new users

**Current Schema**:
```sql
user_id UUID REFERENCES public.profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL
```

**Risk**: If OAuth user doesn't have a profile record yet, foreign key constraint fails

**Recommendation**: Ensure profile is created on user signup

**Priority**: HIGH (could block new users)

**Check**: Need to verify profile creation in auth flow

---

### 10. üîß Potential Error: Missing Indexes for Performance

**Issue**: Some queries might be slow without proper indexes

**Existing Indexes**: Good coverage for most queries
**Recommendation**: Monitor query performance in production

**Priority**: Low (only matters at scale)

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Additional Safety Measures Implemented

### In Migration 006:

1. **Added `status != 'deleted'` checks**
   - Prevents accessing soft-deleted projects
   - Extra safety layer

2. **Simplified permission model**
   - Owner-only access for now
   - Collaboration features can be added incrementally later

3. **Removed all circular references**
   - No policy depends on another policy that depends back
   - Linear dependency chain only

---

## üìã Still Need to Check

### Profile Creation
Need to verify that profiles are created automatically on signup.

**Location to check**: `app/auth/callback/route.ts`
