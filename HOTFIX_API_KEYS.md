# üî• HOTFIX: AI API Keys Not Loading

## Problem Identified

The AI Assistant was showing "I'm having trouble processing that" because:
1. **`.env.local` file was missing** - API keys weren't being loaded
2. **Models were outdated** - Using old model names

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created `.env.local` File ‚úÖ

Added all API keys from `JCALAI_PRIVATE_CONFIG.txt`:
```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaSy... (from config file)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... (from config file)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-... (from config file)

# Plus Supabase keys
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://lhqwlnwvnzremhgfynmu.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbG... (from config file)
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbG... (from config file)
```

**Note**: Actual keys are in `JCALAI_PRIVATE_CONFIG.txt` (not committed to git)

### 2. Updated to Latest Models ‚úÖ

**Before**:
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- GPT-4 Turbo  
- Gemini 1.5 Pro

**After** (as requested):
- **Claude 4.5 Sonnet** (`claude-sonnet-4-5-20250514`)
- **GPT-5** (`gpt-5`)
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash** (`gemini-2.0-flash-exp`)

### 3. Updated UI Labels ‚úÖ

Model selector now shows:
- ü§ñ Auto Select
- üß† Claude 4.5 Sonnet
- üí¨ GPT-5
- ‚ö° Gemini 2.0 Flash (default, fast)

---

## How to Test

1. **Restart dev server** (if running):
   ```bash
   # Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Create new project** or open existing one

3. **Chat with AI Assistant**:
   - It should now respond intelligently!
   - No more "I'm having trouble processing that"
   - Actual conversation with context

4. **Try different models**:
   - Click model selector in AI panel header
   - Switch between Auto/Claude/GPT/Gemini
   - See different response styles

---

## What Changed

**Files Modified**:
1. `.env.local` - **CREATED** with all API keys
2. `lib/ai/model-router.ts` - Updated model names
3. `components/builder/AIAssistantPanel.tsx` - Updated UI labels

**Files Not Modified** (already correct):
- `services/ai-onboarding-service.ts` - API integration code
- `app/builder/[projectId]/page.tsx` - AI panel integration

## Expected Behavior Now

### First Message (Greeting):
```
AI: "Hey! üëã I'm excited to help you build Social Network! 
I see you want to create something around: "Social platform with 
posts, comments, likes, and user connections"

Tell me more about your vision - what's the main goal of this 
project, and who do you see using it?"
```

### User Response:
```
User: "goal is to connect people and it will be many people using this"
```

### AI Follow-up (Should understand context):
```
AI: "Great! A social platform to connect people at scale. 
Let me ask a few more questions:

1. What are the core features you need? (posts, messaging, 
   groups, events, etc.)
2. Any specific age group or community focus?
3. Design preferences - modern/minimalist or feature-rich?"
```

**NOT** the error message anymore!

---

## Troubleshooting

### Still getting errors?

1. **Check `.env.local` exists**:
   ```bash
   ls .env.local
   ```

2. **Verify keys loaded**:
   - Check browser console (F12)
   - Look for API error messages
   - Should NOT see "API key not configured"

3. **Restart dev server**:
   - Environment variables only load on server start
   - Must restart after adding `.env.local`

4. **Check model names**:
   - If API says "model not found", the model name may be wrong
   - Anthropic/OpenAI sometimes change model names
   - Check latest docs if needed

---

## API Key Security

‚úÖ `.env.local` is in `.gitignore`  
‚úÖ Keys won't be committed to Git  
‚úÖ Safe for local development  

‚ö†Ô∏è **For Vercel deployment**: Add same keys to Vercel environment variables:
https://vercel.com/jay-cadmus-projects-02376606/jcalai/settings/environment-variables

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test the fix** - Should work immediately after server restart
2. **Verify all 3 models** - Try Claude, GPT-5, Gemini
3. **Check auto-selection** - Let it pick best model
4. **Report results** - Let me know if still having issues!

---

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED AND READY TO TEST**

The AI should now work properly with real intelligent responses!
